 * 
 * Realization specifications:
 * In order to ease the filtering you must set as service properties the 
 * "schemes" that the given implementation support, by example:
 *  ServiceProperties props;
 *  props["scheme"] = std::string("file");
 *  context->RegisterService<FileSystemModelFactory>(myFSModelFactory, props);
 * 
 * If the model support several FS you must register the service several times
 * with different schemes.
